1. How can we estimate the volume of the cell strain?  Can we get that for the paper?
2. What should be the denominator for the induced vs uninduced? WT?  or uninduced?
3. Metric/measure for change in expression distribution?
   * KL-divergence
   * Wasserstein
   * Euclidean
4. Potential sources of unobserved confounders?
   * Cell stress
   * differences in cell volume
   * differences in growth rates
   * differences in redox state
   * changes in TRN
5. Discussion points:
   * individual flu expression is top 10, but not top 10 KO
6. Validation of method?
   * What can you knock out?  Can we include it in the paper?
